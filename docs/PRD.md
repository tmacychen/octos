# Product Requirements Document: crew-rs

## Executive Summary

crew-rs is a Rust-native AI agent framework that provides both a coding automation CLI and a multi-channel messaging gateway. It supports 14 LLM providers, 8 messaging channels (CLI + 7 platforms), and a rich tool system for autonomous task execution.

## Problem Statement

1. **Fragmented AI tools**: Existing solutions are Python-based, slow, or tied to specific providers
2. **No multi-channel support**: Most coding agents only work via CLI
3. **Vendor lock-in**: Switching providers requires code changes

## Target Users

- **Individual developers**: Automate coding tasks via CLI or chat
- **Teams**: Deploy AI assistant across Slack, Discord, Telegram, etc.
- **DevOps engineers**: Integrate AI into CI/CD with cron and scheduled tasks
- **International teams**: Chinese LLM support (DeepSeek, Qwen, Moonshot, Zhipu, MiniMax)
